# Patient Management

1. A patient who physically comes to the CCC first comes to the Registration Desk.   From there the following details have to be collected and added to a centralised Patient Registry  This patient registry should collect the following details either by Patient Self Registration or Assisted Registration.

Name, Age, Sex, Aadhar Number, Mobile Number.  
Known contacts with Patient with Corona virus \(Yes/No\)  
If Yes - Details  
Significant Medical History  
Are you suffering from any chronic diseases like Diabetes \(Sugar\), Hypertension, Kidney or Heart diseases. If yes, what are the medicines that you are currently taking.  
  
b. A facility to update this Patient Record Daily needs to be there so that there is track of medical history.   
  
This data will be required to send to the hospital \(if a patient is being transferred\)/health department so that they have a comprehensive overview of the status of each patient and overall data in the CCC Network.  
  
Thus, when the doctors are already aware of the 7-14 day history and background details of the patient who is reaching saving time and energy.

c. Patient Handover/Discharge- As soon as patient exits the system by two options  
 1 - Transfer to hospital  
2 - Discharged Home   
  
we need to update the status.  
  
3.  We need a realtime dashboard which show the live data.  
  
4. Once Registration is over a decision should be taken by the doctor on the severity of the condition of the person and then decided as to

1. Send the person back home
2. Admit the person into the CCC 
3. Transfer to a Hospital

If the person is admitted to the CCC then the system has to say which class/building has the available bed for the person. \(desirable\).

5. The system has to thus capture the capacity utilisation of the center and the class/building wise utilisation as well.  
  
There should be a facility to assign patients separately as male and female+children and family \(father+mother+children+grant parents\)  
  
Once the patient is admitted the following parameters are to be monitored every six hours.

1. Fever
2. Cough and Breathing difficulty
3. Any other illness \(status of diabetes/hypertension\)  Treatment: Once a person has cough, we give him clean hot water to gargle in a very comforting and lovely service. This division will be headed by Sharath Krishnan who will ensure everyone is happy during their time at the school.  We have to ensure that the virus doesnt reach the lungs. If it does, we have to boost immunity naturally and sweat it out with the virus.  We encourage all people to observe fasting based on their individual styles. 
4. Our Medical doctors are 100% confident of the plan.

**Criteria for Discharge or Transfer to Hospital**

**&lt;Ramettan to add based on WHO/Health Department Guidelines&gt;**
