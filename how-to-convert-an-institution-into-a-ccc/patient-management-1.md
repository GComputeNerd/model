The following details have to be collected as a patient

Patient Registry needs to have the following  
  
a. Patient Self Registration or Assisted Registration which collect the following information

Name, Age, Sex, Aadhar Number, Mobile Number.  
Known contacts with Patient with Corona virus \(Yes/No\)

Significant Medical History  
Are you suffering from any chronic diseases like Diabetes \(Sugar\), Hypertension, Kidney or Heart diseases. If yes, what are the medicines that you are currently taking.  
  
b. A facility to update this Patient Record needs to be there so that there is track of medical history. This data will be required to send to the hospital \(if a patient is being transferred\)/health department so that they have a comprehensive overview of the status of each patient and overall data in the CCC Network.  
  
Thus, when the doctors are already aware of the 7-14 day history and background details of the patient who is reaching saving time and energy.

c. Patient Handover/Discharge- As soon as patient exits the system by two options  
 1 - Transfer to hospital
