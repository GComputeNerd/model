# Inventory Supplies

There has to be features where government/volunteers are able to see the status and bring required material to each center.  
  
People following the CCC \(lets say in the Alumni Network\) should get real-time updates of the inventory on email/whatsapp/sms/website so that they can ensure the center is fully stocked up.  
  
The following inventories are to be present at the CCC.

1. Handheld Thermal Sensors \(Decide the number later\)
2. 
Medical Inventory  
  
**Office Inventory**

1. Printers with INK Catridges/Laser Printers
2. Glue/Sticky Notes/
