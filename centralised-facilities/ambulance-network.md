  This page describes how to setup an Ambulance Network which connects Public
  and Private Ambulances in a State so that a CCC can reach out to the closest
  ambulance that is free.

# Ambulance Network

The advantage of a an ambulance network is that the driver will be separated from people in back. Each hospital has plenty of ambulances but there has to real-time knowledge of where each ambulance is and whether it is free.  
  
An efficient routing algorithm will transport people from a CCC to the nearby Hospital which has a capacity to absorb a patient who gets really sick.  
  
There has to be a Centralised Patient Medical Record which will inform the Hospital in advance of the basic details of the patient.  
  
The following details have to be collected as a patient

Patient Registry needs to have the following  
  
a. Patient Self Registration or Assisted Registration which collect the following information

Name, Age, Sex, Aadhar Number, Mobile Number.  
Known contacts with Patient with Corona virus \(Yes/No\)  
If Yes - Details  
Significant Medical History  
Are you suffering from any chronic diseases like Diabetes \(Sugar\), Hypertension, Kidney or Heart diseases. If yes, what are the medicines that you are currently taking.  
  
b. A facility to update this Patient Record needs to be there so that there is track of medical history. This data will be required to send to the hospital \(if a patient is being transferred\)/health department so that they have a comprehensive overview of the status of each patient and overall data in the CCC Network.  
  
Thus, when the doctors are already aware of the 7-14 day history and background details of the patient who is reaching saving time and energy.

c. Patient Handover/Discharge- As soon as patient exits the system by two options  
 1 - Transfer to hospital  
2 - Discharged Home   
  
we need to update the status.  
  
d. We need a live dashboard which show the data.
